### Blog
Well, this is my first blog, and first blogpost, so I'm new here, hope I'll get better at writing/being inspired and stuff.
I just get the idea of making a list for future blog entries, that will be a good start.

This post is about why I'm doing this blog, and it's simple, I kind of want to do a blog to commit and try marketing myself in a discipline from some time, and as says some quote I've read I didn't checked the origin:

> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.

So here we are.

### Background 
My name is Jonathan, I'm starting to learn code and want to have some solid foundations to build on.
I went first on Khan Academy, did basics HTML/CSS and a bit of Javascript there, then found FreeCodeCamp, did those same basics, and while hanging on the forums, read about [p1xt's guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/wd-cs.md), and it looks exactly like what I 'm willing to do.
The  guide introduced me to Chingu's Cohort, a motivated group of people doing the same thing I do, so I just joined them and started this journey.
